**Vector**:     
A vector has to be in the format`(x;y;z)`. This system will use the players relative coordinate system.
This means that the vectors x axis is right / left from the players head, the y axis is up or down from where ever the players face is
and the z axis is before / behind the players face. It will move along the players  head.

??? info "Visual Explanation"
    In contrast to their global counterparts, relative x,y,z axes do not change their orientation relative to the player.
    Example: The positive x-axis will always point left from the perspective of the player.
